Previously, we wrote our first Playwright-Test spec. It was simple, but even in a simple script something can go wrong. 

We need a thing which could help us to inspect every step of our test script.

There are **four** ways you can debug your tests:
   
1. Using JavaScript Debug Terminal: 
    
    Lets add new variable which will contain text content of title. 
    Then go to "Run and Debug" tab, open JS Debug Terminal, 
    put breakpoint on line with `expect` statement  and run script once more with `npx playwright test --project="chromium" --headed`. 
    When execution comes to the `expect` statement - debugger will stop program and you will be able to go through the code.

2. Using Playwright Inspector:
    
    Run your script with environment variable `PWDEBUG=1`. 
    
    Windows - `$env:PWDEBUG=1; npx playwright test --project="chromium" --headed`.

    Unix - `PWDEBUG=1 npx playwright test --project="chromium" --headed`. 

    With this variable, Playwright-CLI will open inpsector in the beggining and you will be able step over the code by clicking specific button (put screenshot here, I don't know).

3. Using Playwright TraceViewer:

    Edit playwright config: set `trace: "on"` property. Run script with `npx playwright test --project="chromium" --headed`. 
    After test run there will be folder `test-results` with `trace.zip`. Copy relative path to `trace.zip` and run `npx playwright show-trace`. Example: `npx playwright show-trace ./test-results/first-basic-test-chromium/trace.zip`. It will open TraceViewer where you can inspect the insights of your test.


4. Using [Web version of TraceViewer](https://trace.playwright.dev/). 

    The same as the local version, but you can drop `trace.zip` to web app. Useful when you need to show some insights to non-technical people or open CI results.
